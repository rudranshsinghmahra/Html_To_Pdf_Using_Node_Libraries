# Html_To_Pdf_Using_Node_Libraries
Using Node Libraries We Can Convert HTML to PDF . The Libraries used are : 1.  Handlebars is a simple templating language. It uses a template and an input object to generate HTML or other text formats. Handlebars templates look like regular text with embedded Handlebars expressions. 2.  Puppeteer is a Node library which provides a high-level API to control headless Chrome or Chromium over the DevTools Protocol. It can also be configured to use full (non-headless) Chrome or Chromium.
NOTE --  I am unable to upload the node_modules folder as it contains more than 100 files . 
To download all the dependencies inside the node_modules folder go to your terminal and **type npm i handlebars puppeteer**
